# Contributing

All contributors for any OmniC related project should review the [Code of
Conduct](CONDUCT.md).


## Getting a dev environment set up

1. Ensure you have at least node version 8. Consider using a tool like `nvm` to
manage multiple versions of node.

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Run test server: `npm start` -- this will start 2 test-servers, one to
simulate a OmniC server, and another that serves the front-end and rebuilds
React.JS as needed.

4. The `Clear & Refresh` button simulates a slower OmniC server, adding a few
second delay to serving up all media and serving placeholders instead.

# Contributing a converter

* **WIP:** The current viewer system API will change: This is will eventually
  be an extensible system for which custom builds including or excluding
  certain types are readily available (not everyone wants a kitchen-sink
  approach!).  Until then, the following steps can be followed to add a new
  viewer.

1. Fork this project, get a dev environment gong, etc, so you can get going

2. Create a new Viewer React component class in
`src/components/viewers/your-viewer-name/YourViewerName.js`. It should expect
at least two string properties: `src` (URL or path to media content) and `type`
(all-caps file extension designating expected type)

3. Add any relevant CSS to:
`src/components/viewers/your-viewer-name/YourViewerName.css` (and import into
the JS file)

3. Add a demo to `public/index.html` in the format of the others.

4. Add any additional files necessary for the demo to `mock-omnic/test-media`.
Should include at least a 200x200 JPEG thumbnail and the file itself,
preferably generated by OmniC.

4. Finally, add the viewer to the ViewerLoader, by import your new viewer in
`src/ViewerLoader.js`, and adding it to the switch statement, like:

```
switch 'EXTENSION':
switch 'ANOTHEREXTENSION':
    return YourViewerName;
```
